Preamble

Firstly, I hope you all understand that we should increase team productivity by taking advantage of the flexibility and efficiency of remote working, rather than treating remote working as an alternative to office working.

★ About chat communication
- Focus of simple communication with short content.
- Complement your emotions with emojis, stickers, and team-specific common terms.
- Especially aware of positive feedback, everyone reacts even in trivial matters.
- Let's always say greetings, notify before leaving (going to lunch, leaving the desk,...), always share the status to each others

★ About online meetings
- Be sure to always turn on the camera and let people see your face.
- Do not interrupt others.
- When you listen, tell the others you really understand with a strong nod.
- When you don't need to raise your comment, turn off the micro and reduce background noise as much as possible.
- Decide on agenda and goals in advance and manage your meeting progress and time effectively.

★ About working environment
- Prepare a dedicated working desk instead of a sofa or a bed.
- Prepare an environment that allows you to concentrate, separated from daily life sounds, such as using earplugs or noise canceling headphones.
- Develop a work plan and make it into habit.
- Create your own break time.
- Although you have dedicated communication channel for work, you could create channels outside of work to have better understanding of your own team.

★ About performance
- Make full use of the scheduler and task management tools to visualize your work and share it with your team.
- In particular, everyone should make it a habit to update your tasks status on the task management tool regularly.
- When performing sensitive tasks, frequently share the situation with the team using chat tools and video conferencing tools.
- Do not report daily or weekly only for formal reasons. Use all your responsibilities and enthusiasm.
- Leaders and managers are required comment on the reports.

Don't you feel the productivity could be even higher than working at the office if we can take the above content seriously?
This is such a difficult time, but let's add and update the above tips while accumulate remote working experience.

Please send more and more pull requests to the Github repository.
Thus when the risk of this epidemic disappears, for examples, "creative discussions" and "the process of raising ideas" are performed offline, and "work after actions and tasks are decided" are performed remotely.
We can understand the characteristics of working online and offline, and aim to be the strongest team.
